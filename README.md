HOMEWORK 6: Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard  
Due date: Wednesday, 09/23/20 Midnight Eastern Time (ET)
Student: HENRY JEAN LOGIQUE
Subject: Weather Dashboard Application

```
```
Weather Dashboard Application retrieves the current weather 
and the next five days' forecast from another application's API
and displays it. 

Users enter a city name in the search field and select the Search button. For false entries like no entry or numbers, the application alerts users to renter a correct value. Each time a new city is searched, a new button is created for it in a column on the left. 

Next the city name, the current date, the current weather's condition icon, the temperture, the humidity, the wind speed and the uv index of the selected city are displayed in an area on the top right. 

Right below this area, the next five days' forecast are demonstrated in five separate columns. Each of these columns displays the date, the weather condtion icon, the tempereture and the humidity of one of the next five days.  

Users can select each of the city buttons on the left, and the related weather information are updated at any time. This application saves users's last searched city to the local storage. Once users reload the page or visit the web application later, the weather information of the last searched city is display automatically.

In this assignment I accomplished the followings:

- Created an application which retrieves the weather information from
  the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), using jQuery and Ajax.
- Analyzed the retrieved objects and thier properties to get the
  right information.
- Created the user interface dynamitically through jQuery using the
  Bootstrap components.
- Saved data to the local storage, and later retrived the saved
  data to display the weather information of the last searched city.
- Tested the overall functionality of the app many times and fixed
  the found issues.
- Uploaded the updated files to my personal GitHub repository, and
  made the URLs to my deployed application, and my GitHub repository available.
